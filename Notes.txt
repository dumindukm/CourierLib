Notes

spend around three hours

1. Implementation done only for first three points.
2. No exception handle or edge cases consider or input validation done
3. Didn't create subtypes for parcel as first three tasks not required that abstraction. It's handle with Parcel types
4. Some values hard coded but can use constants and in tests could use inline data or data collections to feed test data
